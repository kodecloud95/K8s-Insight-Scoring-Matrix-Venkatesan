1. Service Configuration (ClusterIP)
The Service acts as the Internal Load Balancer for your backend pods.

Type: ClusterIP: This is the default service type. It exposes the backend on a cluster-internal IP. It is not accessible from the outside world directly (only via Ingress or from the Frontend pod).

Port Mapping:

port: 3000: The port other pods (like your frontend) will use to talk to the backend.

targetPort: 3000: The actual port the application inside the container is listening on.

Selector: Must match the labels in the Deployment (app: backend-deployment) to route traffic correctly.

2. Deployment Configuration
The Deployment manages the Lifecycle of your backend application.

Replicas: Set to 1. In a production scenario, you would increase this to 2 or 3 for high availability.

Image: Uses docker.io/kodecloud95/k8s-insight-backend.

ImagePullPolicy: Always: This ensures that every time a pod restarts, Kubernetes checks the registry for the latest version of the image.

3. Environment Variable Management (Secret vs. ConfigMap)
This is a critical security best practice demonstrated in your code. You are decoupling configuration from the application code.

A. ConfigMaps (Non-Sensitive Data)
Used for configuration that isn't a secret.

MYSQL_DATABASE: The name of the DB schema.

MYSQL_HOST: The DNS name of your MySQL service (e.g., mysql-service).

B. Secrets (Sensitive Data)
Used for credentials that should be encrypted at rest.

MYSQL_USER: Database username.

MYSQL_PASSWORD: Database password.

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: Admin password for the MySQL instance.
